How to Start:
- Open the Terminal (Right click wherever the .jar file is and click Open Terminal)

- In the terminal, type 
java -jar "Java Shell.jar"

How to Operate:

**Basic Operations**
- Type in a command just as you would the normal terminal
- For example: ifconfig
- Type "exit" or "quit" (case does not matter) to end the program
- You can also use ctrl-C

**History**
- You can bring up the history of your commands since you started the Shell
- You can do this by typing "history" (case does not matter)
- You will then be shown a listing of all the commands you have typed
- Each command will have a number associated with it depending on when you entered it
- Type the command !! to perform the most recent command you have entered
- Type ! followed by the number associated with the command in the list to perform that command
- For example !0 will perform the first command you entered since you began the Shell
- If for whatever reason you accidently access the history, just type !leave (case does not matter)

**Changing Directory**
- You can change directory with the cd command just as you can do normally
- Simply type the name of a directory within the directory you are currently in after the cd command
- For example if you are in the /computer/documents directory and you type cd essays you will be brought to the /computer/documents/essays directory
- Furthermore just typing cd will bring you to your home directory
- If your directory is invalid, you will be told so
